**Network Disk Unlocker**

Network Disk Unlocker allows Unraid to decrypt disks using a remote Tang server. This allows for fully secure array unlocking without the need for a keyfile on the server or manual intervention to start the arrray.

Setup requires some manual steps and a remote tang server.

See https://github.com/greycubesgav/clevis-unraid for fully setup instructions.
