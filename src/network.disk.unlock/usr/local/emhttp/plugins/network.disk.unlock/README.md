**Network Disk Unlocker**

Network Disk Unlocker allows Unraid to decrypt disks using a remote Tang server. This allows for fully secure array unlocking without the need for a keyfile on the server or manual intervention to start the arrray.

Setup requires some manual steps and a remote tang server.

Run the setup script as root to setup your encrypted disks:
/usr/local/emhttp/plugins/network.disk.unlock/network.disk.unlock.setup.sh

See https://github.com/greycubesgav/unraid-network-disk-unlock for fully setup instructions.
